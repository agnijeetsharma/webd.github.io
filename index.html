    <h3 style="color:blue">WHAT IS CODING?</h3>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N7ZmPYaXoic/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="problem is there" width=400px>
    <p>Good question here if you want to be a good coder you have to know first of all ,what is coding and how to be a
        good coder?let ma share my personal experience as i have stareted my journey so i can tell you in better
        way.Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer
        what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you
        can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and
        apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things
    </p>
    <h4>HOW TO START</h4>
    <p>Now if you are interseted to be a coder then you must know some point before you start coding .Initially you have
        to choose a intial language so that you can talk to computer and to get work from computer .We all have hopes,
        dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you’re looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current
        job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to your goals. And remember, anyone
        can learn how to code!</p>
    <h3 style="color:red">Which language you can choose intially</h3>
    <p>There are so many languages which can you learn but there some basic language which people prefer most A
        programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets
        of instructions for computers to execute.

        Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages
        rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often
        compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do
        not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>C </li>
        <li>Cpp</li>
        <li>Java </li>
        <li>Javascricpt</li>
        <li>pithon</li>


    </ol>
    <p>If you want know more about these languages you can search on google</p><br>
    <a href="https://google.com">search on google</a>
    <p>search on wikipedia to know more about coding skills</p><br>
    <a href="https://wikipedia.com">search on wikipedia</a>

    <p>Now this is going to be your choice ,what you prefer to learn .I will suggest you to learn c++ or java
        intially then you can go further more languages</p>
    <h4>WHAT NEXT AFTER <bold>programming</bold> LANGUAGE?</h4>
    <P>Now you can lean data sturucture and algorithm(DSA) so that you can be a poblem solver and can get a
        jobProgramming has great opportunities for self-learners around the world. It is very easy for anyone to decide
        to explore a programming language and start coding right away. In the beginning, everyone asks about which is
        the best programming language to learn the basics with, but once they choose they discover it is not just enough
        to learn a language. So, after the enthusiasm of the first step, many learners feel confused about what to do
        next. I even know people who took hard curriculums on Coursera or edX, and they did great. Yet, once they did it
        they didn’t know what to do next.

        This article is a clear seven blocks plan to go through after learning the basics of any programming language.
        These blocks may take seven weeks or more depending on your available time. I hope this article will help more
        people proceed in the field.

    <p>I think , now you have understood basic of coding and now you can expolore about coding.there is many way to sohw
        your brain power and this is one of them and you can earn as much as you want if you are a better coder.All your
        previous work was to learn the fundamentals of the field. Yet, in a way, that gets you deeper and more familiar
        with everything in a way where there is no turning back. It is now time to decide what you want to do and to
        learn the technologies related to your choice.

        There are a lot of tracks and specialities you may go through, and depending on the track, you will know what to
        learn.

        First, list down the tracks and end-products that might be there:
        <bold>Lets show to people power of coding</bold>
    </p>
    <div>
        <h2>Choose your track</h2>
        <p>There is always more. Google to know more. Some YouTube videos and articles try to summarize the trending
            tracks for the current year. Some specialities will be easier than others, more interesting to you than
            others, or highly paid than others. See whatever you prefer and choose. Once you choose the field, try not
            to hesitate, as multiple trials get you lost in this block.</p>

            In the last two blocks, you had a quick introduction to the basics; you were a learner more than a thinker.
            It is time to work on problems that are not clear for you to which topic they belong and to decisions and to
            practice more.

            In this step, I don’t want you to get a medal in Google’s CodeJam or any real competitive programming
            contests out there. You are just a beginner, and this step goal is not to be a winner but to learn more in
            less time.

            All you need to do is to go to websites like Codewars, HackerOne, and Leetcode. To solve and compete with
            others in the problems available on those websites. The more you practice, the faster you will learn. Most
            of these websites will help you go from basic level problems to higher levels step by step.
